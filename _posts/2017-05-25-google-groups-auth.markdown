Don't want to deal with G Suite auth logic in your app? 

No problem! We've just published an Apache module just for that. Set up <a href="https://github.com/RTBHOUSE/google_groups_auth">google_groups_auth</a>-based proxy and you're done.

Proxy will take care of user authentication and basic authorization. And if you ever need more fine control, you can always examine, injected by the proxy, `googlegroups` header directly in your application.

Simple as that!
