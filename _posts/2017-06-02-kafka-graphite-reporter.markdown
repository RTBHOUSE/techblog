Check out our new mini-poject: <a href="https://github.com/RTBHOUSE/kafka-graphite-reporter">Kafka Graphite Reporter</a>.

Why to create one more tool for this? There are several similar solutions present on the market, but metrics reported by this plugin are in line with metrics exposed by Kafka through JMX. This feature makes transition from tools like <a href="https://github.com/jmxtrans/jmxtrans">jmxtrans</a> easier.

Happy monitoring!
