Ladies and gentlemen, here it is! Our pet project:

<img src="http://104.155.95.218/">

Please be aware that in contrast to the production services we work on everyday this service has some unique features:

  * no scalability at all
  * target availability = 20%
  * extreamly low perfomance

We're streaming with an old laptop using some very outdated technologies.

Weird problems and long periods of downtime are more than expected!
